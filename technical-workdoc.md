# AI Trading Agent Workdoc
This is a to-do side paper

  

**Created On**: June 01, 2025
**Version:** 1.1.3

## 1. Introduction

This document serves as a detailed technical breakdown and progress tracker for the Paperhead AI Trading Agent development. While the main [roadmap](README.md#6-roadmap) provides high-level quarterly milestones and strategic direction, this technical workdoc offers granular, actionable tasks with specific completion targets.

**Purpose:**
- **Transparency**: Provides the community with real-time visibility into development progress and task completion status
- **Accountability**: Establishes clear, measurable goals for each development cycle
- **Timeline Clarity**: Gives community members a better understanding of what to expect and when
- **Live Stream Alignment**: Tasks are organized around live streaming sessions, allowing the community to watch development happen in real-time

**Update Cycle:**
This document is updated frequently and reflects tasks intended to be completed over the following 2 weeks. Tasks are marked with completion status and organized by streaming sessions (`this stream`, `next stream`) to align with the live development approach that defines the Paperhead project.

This granular approach ensures that both the community and development team have a clear understanding of immediate priorities, technical challenges, and progress toward the larger vision outlined in the main roadmap.

## 2. Versioning Logic

This document follows a semantic versioning approach to track progress and changes:

- **Major version (X.0.0)**: Complete document restructures, major milestone completions, or significant scope changes
- **Minor version (1.X.0)**: New sections added, significant content updates, or structural improvements to the document  
- **Patch version (1.0.X)**: Task completion updates, small corrections, or minor progress tracking changes

**Example:** When tasks are marked as completed or small updates are made to reflect development progress, the patch version is incremented (e.g., 1.0 â†’ 1.0.1). This helps the community track development momentum and easily see when new progress has been made since their last visit.

## 3. To-do

- [x] create a public workdoc breaks down the technical to-do bi-weekly (side paper)
- [x] update the website to reflect this technical workdoc/todo
- [x] fix chart (complete)
	- [x] data rendering
	- [x] overlay UI
	- [x] Highlight graph data is only mock data, actual agent performance will only start to be tracked when the agent is active and reporting allocations over time
- [x] make readme more accurate for [paperhead-trading-agent](https://github.com/0xpaperhead/paperhead-trading-agent)
- [x] correct the agent app's metadata and favicon
- [x] publish the agent on [agent.paperhead.io](https://paperhead.io)
- [x] add React Query for organized caching and fetching of the agent data
- [x] make popup graph state separate from the main graph load (so it doesn't close when the timerange changes) `this stream`
- [ ] decide privy vs dynamic (user-session generation) `next stream`
- [ ] Implement a robust encryption library to handle pool wallet creation, storage, and access `next stream`
- [ ] implement supabase database for the following:
	- [ ] db initialization, connection, types `next stream`
	- [ ] user creation upon wallet connection
	- [ ] create a shared-custodian user pool upon wallet connection
	- [ ] agent logs
	- [ ] user interactions (user logs?)
- [ ] Implement Redis for secure key export and single-request session logic
- [ ] Implement $PAPERHEAD as currency on agent.paperhead.io
	- [ ] Accept the user's inputted $PAPERHEAD amount and trigger a wallet transaction to the shared-custodial agent-user pool	
- [ ] Implement a listener for the transaction completion/success to initiate agent permission to use the funds and start allocating based on currently held assets proportionally.
- [ ] Implement user controls on the front-end
